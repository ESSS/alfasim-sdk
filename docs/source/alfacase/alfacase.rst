ALFAcase File
*************

ALFAcase file (``.alfacase``) is a file with a textual description of a complete case in text format (YAML).
This file allows the user to write case files directly and execute them directly using the command line.
Being a text file in a standard and well supported format, it also allows the user to execute complex workflows by
manipulating the files using external software or programming languages, providing flexibility and power.

        :program:`ALFAcase` is also referenced as ``ALFAsim case file``
