ALFAcase
========

The |sdk| allows the user to create or edit a project for |alfasim| application by writing the project specification
directly in an :program:`ALFAcase` file.

An ALFAcase file (``.alfacase``) contains a textual description of a complete case in text format (YAML).
This file allows the user to write case files directly and execute them directly using the command line.
Being a text file in a standard and well supported format, it also allows the user to execute complex workflows by
manipulating the files using external software or programming languages, providing flexibility and power.

.. note::

    :program:`ALFAcase` is also referenced as ``ALFAsim case file``


To get quick and running with |sdk| you can read the :ref:`alfacase-quick-start-section` and the
:ref:`alfacase-syntax` sections
